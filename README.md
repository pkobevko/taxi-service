# üöïTaxi Serviceüöï

This is a simple project to show my Java, JDBC, WEB, OOP, and SOLID skills. In this project, I used basic CRUD operations. One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships are used in databases.

#### Project has N-Tier architecture:
| Layer                            | Assignment                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Controllers (Presentation layer) | Receives requests from the client, transmits them to the service layer, and returns JSP pages in response.                                 |
| Services (Application layer)     | Receives requests from the controller layer, transmits them to the DAO layer, <br/>receives a response from the DAO, and executes business |
| DAO (Data access layer)          | Receives requests from the service layer, transfers them to the database, and executes SQL queries                                         |
